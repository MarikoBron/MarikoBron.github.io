title: "About Me"
---

I grew up in Tokyo, Japan, and moved to California when I was 6 years old. I had planned on being a veterinarian since third grade, but in high school I took AP Environmental Science class that immediately changed my trajectory. I ended up attending UC Santa Barbara for their Environmental Studies program and fell in love. I'll be spending this upcoming fall in Australia doing marine biology and ecology fieldwork, and am especially excited to see their unique stick insects and the Great Barrier Reef. Aside from ecology, my core interests include clean energy, urban planning, building strong communities, and soil science.

Outside of school, my interests include cooking, bugs(especially weevils), Pokemon, and taking pictures. To see more about my photography, check out the photography tab!

## Cooking

I enjoy making traditional Japanese food and attempting to create my own recipes even though sometimes it means I end up with a pretty weird dinner. Here are some of my favorite meals I've made!

## Bugs

I'm really excited to check out the bugs in Australia! I'll upload the best Australian bugs to my Critters of Australia tab, but here are some of my favorites.

## Pokémon

I grew up on Pokémon- watching the show, playing the games, and collecting the cards. Now, I get my Poké fix from Pokémon Go, and taking the opportunity to show you some of my best shiny finds.
