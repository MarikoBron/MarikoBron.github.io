# About me:

Hi guys! My name is Mariko, and I'll be graduating UCSB with a B.S. in Environmental Studies. I'll be spending this upcoming fall in Australia engaging in marine biology and terrestrial ecology fieldwork, and am especially excited to see the Great Barrier Reef, the fantastic Australian bugs, and maybe even meet a Kiwi bird.
