In my Data Science class, we used R Studios to conduct our own study on a topic of our choice. My screentime had been abnormally high lately, and sometimes I felt like it was actually higher on days where I had things due. I wondered if this was in my head or a real stress response, and decided to see if I could find the root cause.
