title: "Nasturtium Personal Project"
description: In my Traditional Ecological Knowledge class, I got the opportunity to choose a plant I feel drawn to and get to know her better. We explored the Indegenous belief that to treat nature with true respect, we need to see her as an equal who deserves respect. I learned about her rich history, how to care for her properly, and how she benefits the people, insects, and plants around her.
