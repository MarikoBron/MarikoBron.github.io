In my Traditional Ecological Knowledge class, I got the opportunity to choose a plant I feel drawn to and get to know her better. We explored the Indegenous belief that to treat nature with true respect, we need to see her as an equal who deserves respect. I learned about her rich history, how to care for her properly, and how she benefits those around her.

![Here is a little care guide and face sheet I drew up. Fun fact- the sunnier her environment, she more peppery she tastes!](nasttending.jpeg)

![This is a little bit about her history- she has been quite beloved through time. I sketched a couple of my favorite varietals I've spotted around my community.](nasthistory.jpeg)

![My local public greenhouse had an abundance of nasturtium and told me to gather as much as I wanted! I took them up on the offer immediately.](nasbasket.jpeg)

![I used the seeds, leaves, flowers, and a couple other herbs I gathered around town to prepare for a class potluck.](gathered.jpeg)

![Here's the result after a few rounds of recipe testing! I made pesto from the leaves, capers from the seeds (which took about 6 weeks), and added the herbs and flowers to a sauce, which was lovely spread on a cracker with a few capers.](nasturtiumfoods.jpeg)
