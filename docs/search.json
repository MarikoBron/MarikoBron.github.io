    "text": "I grew up in Tokyo, Japan, and moved to California when I was 6 years old. I had planned on being a veterinarian since third grade, but in high school I took AP Environmental Science class that immediately changed my trajectory. I ended up attending UC Santa Barbara for their Environmental Studies program and fell in love. I’ll be spending this upcoming fall in Australia doing marine biology and ecology fieldwork, and am especially excited to see their unique stick insects and the Great Barrier Reef. Aside from ecology, my core interests include clean energy, urban planning, building strong communities, and soil science.\nOutside of school, my interests include cooking, bugs(especially weevils), Pokemon, and taking pictures.

I learned about her rich history, how to care for her properly, and how she benefits those around her.\n\n\n\nHere is a little care guide and face sheet I drew up. Fun fact- the sunnier her environment, she more peppery she tastes!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a little bit about her history- she has been quite beloved through time. I sketched a couple of my favorite varietals I’ve spotted around my community.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy local public greenhouse had an abundance of nasturtium and told me to gather as much as I wanted! I took them up on the offer immediately.\n\n\n\n\n\nI used the seeds, leaves, flowers, and a couple other herbs I gathered around town to prepare for a class potluck.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s the result after a few rounds of recipe testing! I made pesto from the leaves, capers from the seeds (which took about 6 weeks), and added the herbs and flowers to a sauce, which was lovely spread on a cracker with a few capers."

I’m organizing my piece by hours of screentime (4-11 hours) and using silly icons to show the average sleep and business that pertains to each hour of screentime. The data is organized by increasing screentime, with the bright green battery representing 4 hours and the bright red battery representing a whopping 11 hours. The size of the battery represents how many days involved that screentime and the length of the “To - do” list represents the average number of tasks recorded on days with the corresponding screentime. The “sleepiness” of the eyes represent the average hours of sleep I received on the night before days where I recorded the screentime. This is in the form of hand drawn cartoons that I created on Notability.\nI found that my suspicion of higher screentimes on busier days was not proven by my data, which indicated the opposite. I am very glad I conducted this study because not only did I learn to explore and present data, but I was relieved by my results. I’m also sick of the word screentime, and a bit concerned that two days involved an average of 11 hours."

Describe an affective visualization\nBecause my study aims to measure correlations with screentime, a curiosity driven by my distress over extreme phone-driven procrastination, I want my background to be a phone. Maybe not the most creative, but I didn’t see it in any of the example visualizations. I want to use self explanatory icons to represent my data. I’m thinking something along the lines of hours of sleep being represented by how dark it is outside, or by how tired a character looks. I think I will separate my data by hours of screentime instead of by day because I find the daily data point visualizations, like the “week of goodbyes” postcard, to be a bit disorienting. I am obsessed with the environmental graffiti, but it seems a bit beyond my scope right now."
