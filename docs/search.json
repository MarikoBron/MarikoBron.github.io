    "text": "I grew up in Tokyo, Japan, and moved to California when I was 6 years old. I had planned on being a veterinarian since third grade, but in high school I took AP Environmental Science class that immediately changed my trajectory. I ended up attending UC Santa Barbara for their Environmental Studies program and fell in love. I’ll be spending this upcoming fall in Australia doing marine biology and ecology fieldwork, and am especially excited to see their unique stick insects and the Great Barrier Reef. Aside from ecology, my core interests include clean energy, urban planning, building strong communities, and soil science.\nOutside of school, my interests include cooking, bugs(especially weevils), Pokemon, and taking pictures. To see more about my photography, check out the photography tab!"
